## üß© Modules Overview

- **User Module:** Manages user registration, profile, and role updates (Admin, Editor, Viewer).
- **Auth Module:** Handles authentication (JWT), login, and registration.
- **Document Module:** Enables document upload, retrieval, and metadata management.
- **Ingestion Module:** Orchestrates the PDF summarization process, tracks ingestion status, and logs processing attempts.

## üìö Key API Endpoints

### üìñ API Documentation (Swagger)

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI. You can explore all endpoints, see request/response schemas, and try out the APIs directly from your browser:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://localhost:3000/api/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/docs)

| Endpoint                         | Method | Description                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/auth/register`                 | POST   | Register a new user (default role: Viewer)   |
| `/auth/login`                    | POST   | User login, returns JWT                      |
| `/user/:id/role`                 | PATCH  | Update a user's role (Admin only)            |
| `/document/upload`               | POST   | Upload a new PDF document (Editor only)      |
| `/document/:id`                  | GET    | Get document details by ID                   |
| `/document`                      | GET    | List all documents (with filters)            |
| `/user/profile`                  | GET    | Get current user's profile                   |
| `/ingestion/start/:documentId`   | POST   | Start PDF summarization (async, Editor only) |
| `/ingestion/logs/:documentId`    | GET    | Get ingestion logs and status for a document |
| `/document/:id/summary`          | GET    | Get the summary of a document by ID          |
| `/document/:id/summary/download` | GET    | Download the summary of a document as a file |
| `/document/:id/summary/history`  | GET    | Get the history of summaries for a document  |

## üîÑ User Flow (with API References)

1. **User Registration**
   - User registers via [`/auth/register`](#) (assigned role: Viewer).
2. **Role Upgrade**
   - Admin updates user role to Editor via [`/user/:id/role`](#).
3. **Document Upload**
   - Editor uploads a PDF via [`/document/upload`](#).
   - Document details can be viewed via [`/document/:id`](#).
4. **Start Summarization**
   - Editor triggers summarization via [`/ingestion/start/:documentId`](#).
   - This is asynchronous: backend emits an event to the Python service.
   - API responds immediately with a "started" status.
5. **Track Progress**
   - User checks status/logs via [`/ingestion/logs/:documentId`](#), including attempt numbers and error trails.
   - If processing fails, user can retry; each attempt is logged and visible in the logs.
